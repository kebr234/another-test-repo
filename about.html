  <p> Roasted BBQ and Comedy is regarded as one of the best comedy diners in the country, bringing top comedians of all different styles to you since 2004, along with delicious and affordable BBQ.

    The name Roasted was chosen 12 years ago by the original owner, who equally loved watching comedy and eating BBQ. From that day on, Roasted has set a standard to always make sure our customers
    laugh, find joy, and have a good time, every time they come around. Our goal is to always provide excellent service in a welcoming environment, and consistently showcase the best comedic talent
    available.

    With a focus on excellence, Roasted can accommodate a party of 2 to 200 people. With a full kitchen menu and bar, Roasted is the perfect beginning to any night filled with friends, family and
    stand up comedy.

    Thank you for vising us.

    You are the reason we're here, and if we can do anything to make your time with us even better, just let us know.
